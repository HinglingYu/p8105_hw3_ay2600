## Problem 1

#### Read dataset

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart |> 
  as_tibble()
```

#### Answer the questions

- The `instacart` dataset contains 1384617 of rows, and each row
  representing a single product from an instacart order. Also contains
  15columns, which are variables include identifiers for user, order,
  and product; the order in which each product was added to the cart.
  There are several order-level variables, describing the day and time
  of the order, and number of days since prior order. Then there are
  several item-specific variables, describing the product name
  (e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department (e.g. dairy and eggs, produce), and
  aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits), and whether the item has been
  ordered by this user in the past.

- In total, there are 39123 products found in 131209 orders from 131209
  distinct users.

``` r
# How many aisles
instacart |>
  count(aisle) |> 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644

    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ℹ 124 more rows
